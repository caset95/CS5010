'Hate Crime': The report and unit test files are part of a semester project with colleagues. The goal of the project was to analyze potential factors that may lead to higher rates of hate crimes. We were also required to do unit testing for all of our major functions. The hate crimes csv file was our initial dataset for 2010 to 2015. The 2018 hate crime data is webscraped from the FBI website.
